Solved exercises from the _CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)_ course, from the University of Pennsylvania.

This course provides a short introduction to many Haskell topics, with references to the books _Real World Haskell_ and _Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!_. But, anyhow, it is a great resource for learning Haskell for the many and interesting exercises proposed.

The web of this course, with all the material, can be found in [CIS194 Course](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/).
